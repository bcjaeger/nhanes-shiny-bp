\arguments{
\item{data}{[data.frame]
A set of NHANES data with one row per survey participant and one column per variable. See \link{nhanes_data} for more details
See Details for specific requirements.
See \link{nhanes_data} for an example.}

\item{key}{[data.frame]
A data set with one row per variable and with columns that describe the variable. See \link{nhanes_key} for more details
See Details for specific requirements.
See \link{nhanes_key} for an example.}

\item{outcome_variable}{[character(1)]
The name of the outcome variable to be summarized.}

\item{outcome_quantiles}{[numeric(1+)]
The quantiles to be summarized for a continuous outcome. The default is
\code{c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75)}. For example,
\itemize{
\item \code{outcome_quantiles = c(.5)} will compute the 50th percentile
(i.e., the median)
\item \code{outcome_quantiles = c(.25, .5, .75)} will compute the 25th, 50th,
and 75th percentile.
\item \code{outcome_quantiles = seq(.1, .9, by = .1)} will compute every 10th
percentile, except for the 0th and 100th
}}

\item{outcome_stats}{[character(1+)]

The statistics that should be computed.
Multiple statistics may be requested.
Valid options depend on the type of outcome to be summarized.
For continuous outcomes, valid options include
\itemize{
\item 'mean': estimates the mean value of the outcome
\item 'quantile': estimates 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of the outcome.
}

For categorical outcomes, valid options include
\itemize{
\item 'percentage': estimates the prevalence of the outcome
\item 'percentage_kg': estimates the prevalence and uses Korn and Graubard's method to estimate a 95\% confidence interval
\item 'count': estimates the number of US adults with the outcome.
}}

\item{group_variable}{[character(1)]
The name of the group variable. See Details for a description of
the group variable and the stratify variable.}

\item{group_cut_n}{[integer(1)]
The number of groups to form using the group variable. This is only
relevant if the group variable is continuous, and can be omitted.
Default is 3}

\item{group_cut_type}{[character(1)]
The method used to create groups with the grouping variable. This is only
relevant i fthe group variable is continuous, and can be omitted.
Valid options are:
\itemize{
\item "interval": equal interval width, e.g., three groups with ages of
0 to <10, 10 to <20, and 20 to < 30 years.
\item "frequency": equal frequency, e.g., three groups with ages of
0 to <q, q to <p, and p to <r, where q, p, and r are selected
so that roughly the same number of people are in each group.
}}

\item{stratify_variable}{[character(1)]
the name of the stratify variable. See Details for a description of
the group variable and the stratify variable.}

\item{time_variable}{[character(1)]
The name of the time variable. The default, \code{svy_year}, corresponds to
the variable in \code{nhanes_data} that indicates which 2 year NHANES cycle
an observation was collected in.}

\item{time_values}{[character(1+)]
The time values that will be included in this design object.
The default is to include all time values present in \code{data}.
Valid options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{'most_recent'}: includes the most recent time value.
\item \code{'last_5'}: includes the 5 most recent time values.
\item \code{'all'}: includes all time values present in \code{data}.
\item You can also give a vector of specific time values, e.g.,
\code{c("2009-2010", "2011-2012", "2013-2014")}, if these values are
present in the time_variable column (they are for \code{nhanes_data}).
}}

\item{pool}{[logical(1)]
If \code{FALSE} (the default), results are presented for individual times,
separately. If \code{TRUE}, data from each time value are pooled together.
Note that only contiguous cycles should be pooled together, e.g.,
using \code{pool = TRUE} with \code{time_values = 'last_5'} is okay, but
using \code{pool = TRUE} with \code{time_values = c("2009-2010", "2013-2014")} is
not recommended (that would be a strange result to interpret).}

\item{subset_calls}{[named list(n)]

the names of \code{subset_calls} are variable names, and the values are
values of the variable to include in the subsetted data. For example,
\code{subset_calls = list("demo_gender" = "Women")} will subset the data
to include rows where \code{demo_gender} is equal to \code{"Women"}. Multiple
entries are allowed and collapsed with the logical \code{&} operator.
For example, \code{subset_calls = list(demo_gender = "Women", bp_med_use = "Yes")}
will subset the data to include rows where \code{demo_gender} is equal
to \code{'Women'} AND \code{bp_med_use} is equal to \code{"Yes"}}

\item{standard_variable}{[character(1)]

The name of the variable used to create standardization groups.
The default is to use \code{demo_age_cat}, which leads to age
standardization.}

\item{standard_weights}{[numeric(n)]

The proportionate weights for each group defined by the standard variable.
The number of weights should equal the number of groups defined by
\code{standard_variable} and all weights must be >0.}

\item{statistic_primary}{[character(1)]

the statistic that defines the geometric objects in the plot. Other
statistics will be featured in the text that appears when the users
mouse hovers over the corresponding object.}

\item{title}{[character(1)]

The title that will appear above the plot. If this is not supplied,
the title will be generated using the \code{key} data in \code{x}.}

\item{geom}{[character(1)]

The type of figure that will be made. Valid options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{'bar'} creates a bar plot with annotations on the bars
\item \code{'point'} creates a scatter plot with 95\% confidence interval error bars
}}

\item{reorder_cats}{[logical(1)]

whether to re-order the categorical group variable so that its levels
are shown in increasing order by the expected outcome.}

\item{width}{[numeric(1)]

the width of the plot, in pixels}

\item{height}{[numeric(1)]

the height of the plot, in pixels}

\item{size_point}{[numeric(1)]

the size of points in the plot. (only relevant if \code{'geom' = 'point'})}

\item{size_error}{[numeric(1)]

the size of error bars in the plot. (only relevant if \code{'geom' = 'point'})}
