Description: Use a simple interface to generate summary data and figures
  from the continuous NHANES exam, beginning in 1999-2000 and continuing 
  through 2017-2020. Save your results, either in the form of a dataset
  or as a figure saved to png format. All analyses account for the NHANES
  design weights and are tested for equivalence with CDC statistics and 
  reports.
