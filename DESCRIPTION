Description: Analyze and visualize cardiometabolic outcomes among adults living
  in the United States of America using data from the National Health and 
  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Save your results as a dataset or a 
  figure. All analyses account for the NHANES design weights. Results are 
  tested for equivalence with prior studies and a data brief report from 
  the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
