The key data should have all of the required columns, and should not have any column that is not listed below.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='markup'}

knitr::kable(key_guide, col.names = c("Column name", 
                                      "Column type", 
                                      "Is this column required?",
                                      "The purpose of this column"))

```
